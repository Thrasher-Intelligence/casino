🚨 What This Folder Is

airlock/ is a sandboxed zone for experiments, prototypes, scratch files, and debug scripts that don’t belong in the main repo yet.
It’s a place to:

    Hack on a new idea without breaking anything

    Test unfamiliar Python patterns or UI tricks

    Stress-test a system in isolation

    Dump thoughts in code form

This directory is not tracked by Git (once added to .gitignore) — so whatever happens in the airlock stays in the airlock.
✅ You Can Use This For:

    Trying new UI elements or animation effects

    Writing isolated test cases for tricky logic

    Practicing with parts of the engine before real integration

    Creating temporary files like chipsim_v3_sucksless.py

    Keeping one-off tools, scripts, or personal dev notes

❌ You Shouldn't Use This For:

    Anything you want saved permanently — copy it out before you clean house

    Code that relies on airlock files from the main repo (no circular dependencies)

    Sensitive data or secrets (Git ignores it, but it’s still on disk)

💡 Suggestions

    Use clear names like test_, dev_, scratch_, or date prefixes (e.g. 2025-05-24_royal_flush_detector.py)

    Feel free to treat this like a scratchpad or dev diary

    Clean up once in a while — or don’t. It’s your vacuum-sealed mess.

TL;DR:
airlock/ is a creative quarantine zone — useful, disposable, yours.

Breathe freely. Hack bravely.
Just don’t open the outer door until you’re ready.
